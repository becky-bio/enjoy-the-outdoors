# enjoy-the-outdoors
This is a project about creating a list on National Parks. Users need to be able to search the list using a Search by State and Park type filter. One interesting thing I learned from this project was creating loops. It was very frustrating at first because it wasn't working, but I gained of confidence after writing the loop.
